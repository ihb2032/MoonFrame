# Engine-seam lock. MoonBit has no visibility between `priv` (this package) and
# `pub` (anyone), so a kernel two public packages share has to be `pub`. The
# repository's answer is a pair of attributes — `#internal(engine, …)`, which
# alerts a *downstream* caller, and `#doc(hidden)`, which keeps the symbol out
# of the generated `.mbti` — and that second attribute is exactly why no other
# guard can see these symbols: the facade lock reads `.mbti` files, so the seam
# surface is invisible to it. What is invisible grows.
#
# This reads the sources instead and pins every `pub` declaration in a public
# package that carries either attribute, with its normalised signature:
#
#   <pkg> | <attrs> | pub fn mask_true_indices(mask : Series) -> Array[Int]?
#
# Signature and not just the name, because the risk here is a seam quietly
# widening — one that used to return a `Series` starting to return the column's
# own `Array`, say, which hands another package the ability to mutate a value
# that is supposed to be immutable. That shows up as a diff.
#
# One rule is checked outright rather than snapshotted: `#internal(engine)`
# without `#doc(hidden)` is incoherent — the symbol would sit in the public
# interface as a compatibility promise while alerting anyone who used it. The
# reverse (`#doc(hidden)` alone) is legitimate but rare, and the snapshot is
# where it gets approved: `DataFrame::check_invariants` carries no alert on
# purpose, because the blackbox test packages that assert on it live outside
# `frame` and would each trip one under `--deny-warn`.
#
# Nothing here upgrades a seam into a compatibility promise. The point is that
# adding one, or widening one, is a decision someone made on purpose:
#
#   sh .github/scripts/check_engine_seams.sh --write
#
# Usage: .github/scripts/check_engine_seams.sh [repo-root] [--write]
# Exit 0 when the seams match the snapshot, 1 on drift (or a missing one).
