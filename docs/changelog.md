# Changelog

Version-by-version feature history for MoonFrame, newest first. The
authoritative public-API reference is [`api.md`](api.md); the source-level
breaking-change steps for each release are collected in
[`migration.md`](migration.md). Pre-1.0, breaking changes ride the minor
version.

## v0.5 — one expression engine

The breaking release that finishes what v0.4 started: the eager and lazy
surfaces **converge onto a single, Polars-shaped expression engine**, and the
parallel spellings that grew up alongside it are retired. This is the **last**
breaking release — from v0.6 on the surface only grows. The source-level upgrade
steps are collected in [`migration.md`](migration.md).

### One engine for the four verbs

`select` / `filter` / `agg` / `with_columns` each take `Expr`s now, on both
`DataFrame` and `LazyFrame`; the v0.4 `select_exprs` / `filter_where` /
`agg_exprs` twins, the `AggSpec` reduction specs, and the closure `filter` are
all gone. The closure's per-row power moves *into* the engine as two escape
hatches — `col("q").map_elements(label, f)` (one input) and
`map_many(label, inputs, f)` (several) — still a closure over the row's cells as
`Scalar`s, but carried by an inspectable, pushdown-able `Expr` rather than an
opaque function. And because the verb *is* the expression form, a reduction can
run over a derived column: `(col("revenue") - col("cost")).sum()`.

### Expression keys everywhere

`sort` (renamed from `sort_by`), `group_by`, `join`, and the `drop` family name
their keys with `Expr`, so a key can be derived rather than just a column name.
`join` collapses the per-type `inner_join` / `left_join` / `right_join` /
`outer_join` / `cross_join` methods into the single `join(other, JoinOptions)`
(Polars has no `*_join`) and gains `left_on` / `right_on` for differently-named
keys. `sort` keeps one deliberate non-Polars behaviour — a `NaN` sorts as
missing, by the tuple's `NullOrder` (the v0.2 choice).

### A wider expression vocabulary

- **Aggregations** `std` / `variance` / `median` / `n_unique` / `first` /
  `last` join `sum` / `mean` / `min` / `max` / `count` (sample statistics for
  `std` / `variance`; `median` skips `NaN`; `first` / `last` are positional).
- **A string namespace**: `str_to_uppercase` / `str_to_lowercase` /
  `str_strip_chars` / `str_len_chars` / `str_contains` / `str_starts_with` /
  `str_ends_with` / `str_replace` / `str_replace_all` (literal matching, no
  regex), each a first-class, introspectable `Str` node.
- **`fill_null` on the expression layer**: `col("x").fill_null(value)` (the
  value is any `Expr` — a literal, another column for a coalesce, or a tree),
  plus a whole-frame `df.fill_null(value)`. The old per-column frame method is
  removed.
- **`lit_series`** embeds a `Series` as a (broadcasting) expression, and
  **`cols(["a", "b"])`** expands names to `col` expressions.

### Row access, reductions, and dedup, Polars-shaped

The rich `RowView` is retired: `df.row(i)` returns an `Array[Scalar]` (a
positional row) and the new `df.rows()` returns them all. The column-scalar
reductions give way to Polars' pair — `df.sum()` / `mean()` / `min()` / `max()`
/ `count()` reduce to a **one-row `DataFrame`**, while a single scalar comes from
`df.get_column(c).sum()`. `df.unique()` drops duplicate rows, keeping
first-appearance order.

### Lazy file sources

`scan_csv` / `scan_ndjson` (and their `_with_options` variants) start a lazy
plan straight from a file. The optimizer's **projection pushdown** reaches into
the source: a column the plan never reads is never parsed, so
`scan_csv("sales.csv").select([col("region"), col("revenue")]).collect()` reads
only those two columns. (An array-shaped JSON document has no row-wise scan to
push a projection into, so there is no `scan_json`.)

### `Series` in its own package; naming finalised

`Series` is extracted from `frame` into a new `series` package, so the
expression layer can build on the per-column unit (the facade name
`@moonframe.Series` is unchanged). The last non-Polars names are aligned:
`min_value` / `max_value` → `min` / `max`, `take` → `gather`, `unique_count` →
`n_unique`, `to_int` / `to_float` / `to_string_series` → `cast`, and
`DataFrame::get(i, c)` → `item(i, c)`; `null_rate` is removed.

## v0.4 — shipped

A Polars-style expression engine and a lazy query layer, both **purely
additive** on top of the v0.3 core — two new packages (`expr`, `lazy`) and new
`DataFrame` / `GroupedDataFrame` methods, with nothing changed in the v0.2 /
v0.3 surface (nothing for [`migration.md`](migration.md)). Also folds in the
post-v0.3 whole-library review's join follow-ups.

### Expression engine (the `expr` package)

A reified, composable column expression. `col("name")` and `lit_int` /
`lit_float` / `lit_str` / `lit_bool` / `lit` build the leaves; the overloaded
operators `+ - * /` (arithmetic — `/` is always `Float`, dividing by zero to
IEEE `±inf` / `NaN` rather than trapping), `&` / `|` (Kleene-logical, **not**
bitwise), and unary `-` compose them; and the methods `eq` / `ne` / `lt` /
`le` / `gt` / `ge` (comparisons → `Bool`), `not` / `is_null` / `is_not_null`,
the aggregations `sum` / `mean` / `min` / `max` / `count`, `cast`, and
`with_alias` extend them. `when(cond).then(a).otherwise(b)` is a row-wise
conditional. Building a tree is **total** (it never fails); `explain()` and the
`Show` impl render the operator form, and `referenced_columns` / `output_name`
introspect it. An `Expr` is read-only outside `expr` — built through the
surface above, never by naming a variant.

### Eager expression consumers (the `frame` package)

The whole-frame evaluator and its `DataFrame` / `GroupedDataFrame` consumers:
`with_columns` (derive or replace columns), `select_exprs` (project to the
evaluated expressions — an all-aggregation selection collapses to one row),
`filter_where` (vectorized boolean row selection — a reified, pushdown-able
alternative to the closure `filter`), and `agg_exprs` (the expression form of
`agg`, generalising `AggSpec` to compound reductions like
`(col("revenue") - col("cost")).sum()`). Evaluation is vectorized with
`Int` / `Float` promotion, null propagation, Kleene logic, and the `Series`
reduction's `NaN` rules.

### Lazy query layer (the `lazy` package)

`lazy_frame(df)` (or `LazyFrame::from(df)`) starts a deferred plan; total
builder methods mirroring the eager verbs grow it; `explain()` prints it; and
`collect()` runs it. With no optimizer in front, a collect is bitwise-equal to
the eager pipeline. The optimizer adds two result-preserving rewrites —
**predicate pushdown** (sink each filter toward the scan, past the stages it
provably commutes with) and **projection pushdown** (insert a narrowing
selection over a scan whose consumers read only a subset of its columns) — so
`explain()` versus `explain(optimized=true)` is a before/after view of what the
optimizer moved and pruned. `LazyFrame::group_by(keys).agg(exprs)` is the lazy
mirror of the eager grouping.

### Join — duplicate-key check and backend preservation

- `join` now rejects a **key repeated in `on`** with `DuplicateColumn`,
  matching `group_by(["id", "id"])` and `select`'s "no duplicate keys"
  contract (previously `on = ["id", "id"]` silently behaved as the single key
  `["id"]`). A *missing* repeated key still surfaces as `ColumnNotFound` at its
  first appearance.
- Join output columns now **preserve the storage backend** of their source
  where they pick up no unmatched-row null — an all-valid `Numeric` source
  column stays `Numeric` instead of demoting to `Builtin`, matching `filter` /
  `sort_by` / `take` / `drop_nulls` / `fill_null`. Only the representation
  changes; values and dtypes are identical.

## v0.3 — shipped

Output formats, the full join matrix, read resilience, and a pluggable
column-storage backend, all on top of the v0.2 method-chain core. The
source-level upgrade steps are in [`migration.md`](migration.md).

### HTML rendering (output format)

`df.to_html()` renders a `<table>` — a `<thead>` header over a `<tbody>` of
rows, with a null cell rendered as `<td></td>` — and
`df.to_html_with_options(...)` adds a CSS `class`, a `<caption>`, and (via
`HtmlOptions::with_max_rows`) a row cap with a `<tfoot>` `... (K more rows)`
banner. Header and cell text is HTML-escaped (`&` / `<` / `>` / `"`) by
default; `with_escape(false)` passes trusted markup through. Like
`to_markdown`, it is a pure, dependency-free `DataFrame` method (the IO-1
boundary keeps rendering in `frame`).

### Vega-Lite chart export (output format)

`format_vega_lite(df, ChartSpec::bar("region", "revenue"))` emits a complete
[Vega-Lite v5](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) specification — `$schema` +
optional `title` + `mark` + `encoding` + an inline `data.values` array — as a
JSON string you can paste straight into the
[Vega editor](https://vega.github.io/editor/) or feed to any Vega-Lite runtime.
`ChartSpec::bar` / `line` / `point` / `area` choose the mark; `with_color` adds
a grouping column and `with_title` a heading; each channel's field `type` is
inferred from the column dtype (numeric → `quantitative`, else `nominal`), and
cells follow the JSON-records conventions (null / non-finite floats → JSON
`null`). Being an `io` serialiser (parallel to `format_json_records`), a spec
that names a missing column raises `ColumnNotFound`; `write_vega_lite` is the
file wrapper.

### Join matrix completed — Right / Outer

`JoinType` gained `Right` / `Outer`, so the matrix is now the full
`inner` / `left` / `right` / `outer` / `cross`. `left.inner_join(right, ["id"])`,
`.left_join` / `.right_join` / `.outer_join`, or the configurable
`left.join(right, JoinOptions::on(["id"]).with_how(Outer).with_coalesce(true))`
do a hash equi-join with Polars-aligned semantics: a **null** key matches
nothing (`null != null`, as in SQL / Polars), a `NaN` key matches other NaNs,
the right-column collision suffix defaults to `"_right"`, and key columns are
coalesced on an inner join but kept (the right as `id_right`) on a
left / right / outer join — `coalesce` defaults to Polars' per-`how` rule and is
overridable via `with_coalesce` (a coalesced key takes each row's value from
whichever side is present: the left for `inner` / `left`, the right for `right`,
the present side per row for `outer`). Output is the left columns then the right
columns, rows in deterministic order. `left.cross_join(right)`
(`JoinType::Cross`) gives the keyless Cartesian product.

### CSV / JSON / NDJSON read resilience

All three readers' option structs gained escape hatches for messy inputs.
`infer_schema_rows = 0` (or any value `<= 0`) now scans *every* row rather than
a leading window (Polars' `infer_schema_length=None`), so a dtype that only
resolves deep in the data is inferred instead of guessed from a prefix.
`on_parse_error` (`OnParseError::Raise`, the default, or `Null`) chooses what
happens when a non-null cell past the inference window doesn't fit its column's
locked-in dtype: fail the whole read with `ParseError` (lossless) or downgrade
that one cell to a null and keep going (Polars' `ignore_errors=True`), with the
column keeping its inferred dtype. CSV additionally gains
`allow_nonfinite_floats` (default `true`): set it `false` to stop a column of
`nan` / `inf` / `infinity` tokens from being silently inferred as `Float`,
falling back to `String` instead. These are `pub(all)` struct field additions —
see [`migration.md`](migration.md).

### Pluggable column storage (engineering depth)

A `Series` now holds a `ColumnStorage` — a closed `{ Builtin; Numeric }` seam —
instead of a bare `BuiltinColumn`. `Builtin` is the general-purpose Arrow column
(any dtype, nullable); `Numeric` is an all-valid, unboxed `Int64` / `Double`
column that carries **no validity bitmap**, so it skips the bitmap allocation on
construction and the per-slot validity check in its reductions (the
`null_count == 0` fast path). The no-null `Series::from_ints` / `from_floats`
build `Numeric` automatically, and structural transforms (`slice` / `take` /
`drop_nulls` / `head` / `tail` / `filter` / `sort_by`) keep a column on the fast
path. `storage_kind()` reports the backend; `to_numeric()` / `to_builtin()` move
between them (per-column on a `Series`, whole-frame on a `DataFrame`) — a
lossless representation swap that leaves names, dtypes, and values unchanged.

## v0.2 — method-chain migration

The whole v0.1 surface moved to the method-chain + `raise` form (see
[`migration.md`](migration.md) for the call-site changes).

- The operator verbs (`select` / `drop` / `rename` / `with_column` /
  `replace_column` / `filter` / `sort_by` / `drop_nulls` / `drop_nulls_in` /
  `fill_null` / `null_count` / `count` / `sum` / `mean` / `min` / `max` /
  `describe`) became **methods on `DataFrame`**; the old `ops` package folded
  into `frame`.
- Every fallible operation returns `T raise DataError` instead of
  `Result[T, DataError]`.
- `filter` takes a single `(RowView) -> Bool raise DataError` predicate (the
  v0.1 `filter` / `filter_try` split is gone — a fallible accessor in the
  predicate just raises).
- `sort_by` takes an `Array[(column, SortOrder, NullOrder)]`; multi-key sort
  falls out of listing several tuples (`sort_by_many`, the `SortSpec` struct,
  and the `IntoSortSpecs` trait are all gone).
- `to_markdown` / `to_markdown_with_limit` are `DataFrame` methods; the
  CSV / JSON string serialisers (`format_csv_str` / `format_json_records`) stay
  as `io` free functions.

**GroupBy.** `df.group_by(keys).agg([AggSpec::sum("x"), AggSpec::mean("y"), ...])`
returns a one-row-per-group summary with `Count` / `Sum` / `Mean` / `Min` /
`Max` reductions (reusing the `Series` statistics, with Polars-aligned `NaN`
rules: a `NaN` propagates through `Sum` / `Mean` but is skipped by `Min` /
`Max`), optional per-column aliases via `with_alias`, deterministic
first-appearance group order (Polars' `maintain_order=True`), and null keys kept
as their own group.

**Join (inner / left / cross).** The hash equi-join landed with the
`inner` / `left` / `cross` cases; the `right` / `outer` completion came in v0.3
(see the v0.3 entry above for the full semantics).

**NDJSON I/O.** `read_ndjson` / `write_ndjson` (and the string-level
`parse_ndjson_str` / `format_ndjson`) read and write the JSON Lines format — one
JSON object per line — reusing the JSON-records type inference and
`scalar_to_json` cell conventions. Reading is lenient (blank lines skipped, CRLF
tolerated); writing emits one compact object per row, each terminated by `\n`.

## v0.1 — foundation

The initial column-oriented core: an Apache Arrow-style column layout
(byte-packed validity `Bitmap`, `1 = valid`) under `Series` / `DataFrame`, an
`O(1)` `name_to_index` cache, `DataFrame::check_invariants()` as a formal
structural spec (INV1–INV7) asserted by every operator test, and the first
CSV / JSON readers with `Int → Float → Bool → String` type inference (see
[`type-inference.md`](type-inference.md)).
